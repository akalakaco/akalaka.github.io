PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.

Akalaka respects your privacy and is committed to being transparent with you about how we handle personal information.

This Privacy Policy explains how Akalaka collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use the Akalaka Platform ("Platform"), or otherwise interact with us. It also goes over how you can exercise your privacy rights and choices.

The Platform is designed to allow Creators to build, design, publish, and sell courses, coaching and other services to their Students. This Privacy Policy applies when you access or use the services and tools offered through our Platform ("Akalaka Services"), or otherwise interact with us. Your access to our Platform and use of Teachable Services is also governed by our Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy can be found in our Terms of Use.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully prior to accessing our Platform and using Akalaka Services. If you have any questions, please contact us at: akalakaco@gmail.com.

You may find a PDF copy of this policy by clicking here.

Children

As stated in our Terms of Use, you must be at least 18 years old to use the Platform, or, if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you must have your parent or guardian's permission to use the Platform. Akalaka does not knowingly collect or store any personal information from or about children under the age of 13, and we will delete such information if we become aware that it has been submitted through our Platform.

Parents or guardians who believe that Akalaka might have any personal information from or about a child under the age of 13 may submit a request to akalakaco@gmail.com for us to remove such information.

Overview

Personal information refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. How we handle your personal information will depend on whether we act as a "controller" or as a "processor" of the personal information. The controller is the entity that decides how and why to process personal information. The processor processes personal information on behalf of the controller at the controller's direction.

Akalaka's Role as a Controller of Your Personal Information. Akalaka is the controller of personal information that it collects and processes in connection with the use of our marketing site and the provision of Akalaka Services. This includes personal information that you provide to us when you create an account on the Platform, subscribe to a Teachable plan, enroll in a course, purchase Coaching through our Platform, etc. Please refer to the "Personal Information We Collect" section of this Privacy Policy for more information about personal information that Teachable collects as a controller.

Akalaka's Role as a Processor of Personal Information Collected by Creators. Creators are the owners of content that they upload, submit, or otherwise provide to the Platform ("Creator Content") and are the controller with respect to any personal information included in their Creator Content. Akalaka acts as a processor when it processes Creator Content on behalf of the Creator.

When a Student enrolls in Creator Content, Akalaka will provide the Creator access to a limited set of personal information about the Student ("Student Data") to enable the Creator to provide their services to the Student. Akalaka and Creators may each use Student Data for their own business purposes, at all times subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Data Processing Agreement and our Terms of Use. The Creator and Teachable each act as an independent controller with respect to their particular use of Student Data.

Creators acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the protection of personal information for which they are controllers.

If you are a Student whose personal information has been collected by a Creator, please contact the Creator directly and view the Creator's privacy policy if you have questions about how the Creator uses your personal information.

Personal Information We Collect

Akalaka collects personal information about you in several different ways, depending on how you interact with our Platform. Please note that the types of personal information we collect differs depending on how you're using our Platform, for example, as a Creator or a Student.

Personal Information You Give Us (Or that We May Receive From Others).

We collect personal information you directly provide to us. We may also receive personal information about you from others; e.g. from another user or our payment processors.

Personal Information We May Collect From Any Users of Our Platform.

Account Information. To use certain features of our Platform (such as to create a course or to enroll in a course), you'll need to register for an account with Akalaka. To do so, you'll need to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, and password.
Third Party Integrations. You may allow our Platform to interact with third party services (such as Facebook and Zoom). The information you allow Akalaka to access varies by service, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and those that you are connected with establish while using such services. Third-party services are operated, controlled, and maintained by third parties that are not operated, controlled, or maintained by Akalaka. We recommend that you read the terms of use and privacy policies of those third party services to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information with us or other third parties.
Other Personal Information.You may choose to provide us with other personal information. For example, we may collect your name, email address and other personal information when you fill out a survey, participate in a Akalaka-sponsored contest or promotion, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
Personal Information We May Collect from Creators.

Akalaka Plans. When you subscribe to a paid Akalaka plan, we will collect certain personal information from you for the purposes of billing your subscription fees and any payment service fees, such as your business and billing address. You'll also need to provide certain payment-related information directly to our third party-payment processors, as described below.
Creator Payment Information. If you're using Akalaka's Native Payment Gateways, you'll need to link your payment account to our Platform to receive payouts. By linking your account, Akalaka will receive certain payment related information about you, including your payment card type and last four digits, postal code, country of origin, payment expiration date, and any email address associated with the payment type.

Third Party Payment Processors. We use third party payment processors like PayPal and Stripe to process payments through the Akalaka Platform.

For security purposes, Akalaka does not collect or receive any sensitive payment information, such as your complete card number or authentication data.

For additional information about how your payment information is processed and stored, we recommend that you review the applicable payment processor's privacy policy.

Please keep in mind that all of the information that you share or content that you publish in your bio, posts, comments, or other public portions of our Platform becomes public information. Because this information is publicly available, we cannot control how others treat it. We ask you to exercise care in deciding what personal information you choose to share, and refrain from sharing your sensitive personal information and those of others.

Other Information
Information Security

Teachable uses a range of physical, technical, and administrative security measures to protect your personal information. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of financial information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. However, no method of data transmission or storage system is absolutely secure, and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed in the event of a breach of any of our security measures.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password to access certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for protecting this password and keeping it confidential. As the safety and security of your information also depends on the precautions you take, we ask you not to share your password with anyone. If you believe your password or the security of your account has been compromised, you should change your password immediately and contact akalakaco@gmail.com with any concerns.

Data Retention

We save personal information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is collected and processed. Generally, we will keep your personal information until your account is deleted, or as needed to provide you with our services. We will also retain certain personal information to comply with our legal obligations or for our legitimate business purposes.

International Transfers of Information

Teachable is based in the United States and it stores, processes, and transfers information in and to servers and databases located in the United States. It may also store, process, and transfer information in and to servers in other countries depending on the location of its affiliates and service providers.
